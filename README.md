I try to build a program to record the transactions according to this:
Cash Flow Rebalance = Delta { F ( Port Value T(0) , Asset price T(0) ) } , { F (Port Value T(1) , Adjust %Diff Asset price (T1:T0) }
I'm not sure if I made a mistake please suggest me if you guys found something wrong with my code.
